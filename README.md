# Coframe Variant Building Challenge

Hey there! This repo contains my submissions for the Coframe Mark-1 challenge. Each variant showcases different approaches to improving conversion through web experimentation.

## What's Inside

### Website 1: Ramp.com

**Variant A** - Changed the hero headline to "Finance automation that actually works." Simple but more concrete and benefit-focused than the original.

**Variant B** - Added a clean "How it Works" section with 3 steps below the hero. Helps visitors understand the value prop quickly with minimal friction.

**Variant C** - Built an interactive ROI calculator that lets users see potential savings based on their monthly spend and team size. Real-time calculations make it engaging and personalized.

### Website 2: MemoryAir

**Variant D** - Replaced the main product image with a fresh AI-generated visual. Sometimes a better hero image is all you need.

**Variant E** - Added a key benefits section with icons highlighting device features: real-time tracking, health monitoring, and battery life. Makes the value props more scannable.

### 🎨 Creative Bonus

**Variant F** - Added a sticky savings counter banner at the top showing real-time savings: "Finance teams have saved $X million this month with Ramp." Creates urgency and FOMO to drive conversions.

**Hypothesis:** A live-updating counter showing "Finance teams have saved $X million this month" creates FOMO and increases email signups by 8-12%.

## Structure

Each variant folder contains:
- `variant.js` - The code that makes the magic happen
- `desktop-screenshot.png` - How it looks on desktop
- `mobile-screenshot.png` - Mobile view
- Some variants have extra mobile views if needed

## Notes

The variants use the `cf:` prefix for scoped Tailwind classes to avoid conflicts with existing site styles.

Built with attention to:
- Responsive design (mobile + desktop)
- Clean, readable code
- Performance (minimal DOM manipulation)
- Brand consistency
